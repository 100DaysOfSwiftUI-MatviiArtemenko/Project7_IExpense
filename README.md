> *Although the app we were building wasn’t itself difficult, getting there took quite a bit of learning – we had to cover `UserDefaults`, `Codable`, `sheet()`, `onDelete()`, `@StateObject`, and more. Some of those things – particularly `UserDefaults` and `Codable` – have only been introduced at a high level in this project, which is intentional; we’ll be getting into them more later on.*

## &nbsp; 📚 Covered topics

  UserDefaults, Codable, sheet(), onDelete(), @StateObject

## &nbsp; 🎖 Challenge
* [x] Use the user’s preferred currency, rather than always using US dollars.

* [x] Modify the expense amounts in `ContentView` to contain some styling depending on their value – expenses under $10 should have one style, expenses under $100 another, and expenses over $100 a third style. What those styles are depend on you.

* [x] For a bigger challenge, try splitting the expenses list into two sections: one for personal expenses, and one for business expenses. This is tricky for a few reasons, not least because it means being careful about how items are deleted!
